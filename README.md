# Marketing Campaign Dashboard (Streamlit)

This repository contains a small, self-contained analytics dashboard built using a **public Kaggle dataset**.  
The purpose of this project is to illustrate my general approach to **data storytelling, insight generation, and decision-focused visualization**.

All data is public and synthetic.

## What This Demonstrates

- How I structure dashboards around decision-making
- How I surface trade-offs (scale vs efficiency)
- How I reduce noise rather than maximize metrics
- How I design for executive consumption
